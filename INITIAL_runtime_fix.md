## The Goal

Resolve the Vercel build error `Error: Function Runtimes must have a valid version` by correctly configuring the Node.js runtime for the deployment. The objective is to ensure Vercel uses Node.js 18.x for the serverless functions, allowing the build to succeed and the `/api/generate-image` endpoint to be deployed correctly.

---

## Inspiration & Examples

- **File:** `examples/config/vercel-with-runtime.json`  
  **Reason:** Shows how to explicitly set the Node.js runtime in `vercel.json` to override any inference issues.

- **File:** `examples/package/package-with-engines.json`  
  **Reason:** Reinforces the correct structure for `package.json` with `engines` and `"type": "module"`.

- **File:** `examples/api/runtime-check.js`  
  **Reason:** A simple API to verify the Node.js runtime that Vercel is actually using for the function.

- [Vercel Function Runtimes and Node.js](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/node.js)
- [Node.js version management for deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes#node.js-version)

## ⚠️ Potential Pitfalls & Gotchas

- **`engines` vs Vercel Config:** Sometimes Vercel might ignore `engines` in `package.json` if not explicitly configured.
- **Conflicting Runtimes:** If both `package.json` and `vercel.json` specify runtimes, ensure they match.
- **Cache Issues:** Vercel's build cache can sometimes be stubborn; a cache reset might be needed.
- **Node.js Version Specifics:** While `18.x` is good, some environments might prefer a specific minor version like `18.17.0`.
